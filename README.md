> Foundry x Huff Integration Tooling


## Getting Started

Huff is a low-level EVM programming language designed for developing highly optimized smart contracts.

To learn more about Huff, visit the [Huff Website](https://huff.sh/) or [_read the docs_](https://docs.huff.sh/).

If you don't already have `huffc` installed, run:

```bash
curl -L get.huff.sh | bash
huffup
```


## Building, Testing, and Deploying

This repository provides scaffolding for integrating [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs) into your [Huff](https://huff.sh/) project.

First, install foundry dependencies with `forge install && forge update`.

Then, you can run `forge test` to test the example `.huff` contract in the `src/` directory.

As with any `.huff` contract, you can compile each contract directly by using `huffc` (the Huff compiler). For example, to compile `src/SimpleStorage.huff`, run: `huffc -b src/SimpleStorage.huff`.
